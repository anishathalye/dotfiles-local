#      - sets up standard environment variables
#      - sources user file ~/.bash_environment, if it exists
#      - sets standard path
#      - sets up standard shell variables, aliases, etc.
#      - source user file ~/.bashrc.mine, if it exists

# If you want to ADJUST the bash initialization sequence, create any of
# the following files (as appropriate) in your home directory, with commands
# to achieve the effect listed:
#
#      .bash_environment - setup session environment (set environmental
#                         variables, attach lockers, etc.)
#      .bashrc.mine  - setup bash environment (set shell variables, aliases,
#                     unset system defaults, etc.)

# In most cases, you will never need to edit this file.  All the
# customizations you could want to make can be made by editing one
# of the user dotfiles, such as ~/.bashrc.mine, ~/.bash_environment, or
# ~/.startup.tty.
#
# WARNING: If you revise this .bashrc file, you will not automatically
# get any changes that Athena may make to the system-wide file at a
# later date.  Be sure you know what you are doing.
