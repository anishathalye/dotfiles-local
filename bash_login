#      - sources the ~/.bashrc file
#      - performs standard setups appropriate for tty session
#      - runs standard startup activities (e.g., check mail)
#      - source user file ~/.startup.tty, if it exists

# If you want to ADJUST the login initialization sequence, create a
# .startup.tty file in your home directory, with commands to run activities
# once the environment has been set up (znol, emacs, etc.).

# To adjust the environment initialization sequence, see the instructions in
# the .bashrc file.

# In most cases, you will never need to edit this file.  All the 
# customizations you could want to make can be made by editing one
# of the user dotfiles, such as ~/.bashrc.mine, ~/.bash_environment, or
# ~/.startup.tty.
# 
# WARNING: If you revise this .bash_login file, you will not
# automatically get any changes that Athena may make to the
# system-wide file at a later date.  Be sure you know what you are
# doing.
